# FreedomWing Joystick Adapter

## Overview

The FreedomWing Joystick Adapter provides a way to connect a powerchair joystick to a gaming system. This can enable someone to game with the same joystick they use to control their powerchair. This adapter is compatible with joysticks that attach to the powerchair via a DB9 connector. 

The FreedomWing was designed by [ATMakers](http://atmakers.org/) in collaboration with [The AbleGamers Charity](http://ablegamers.org/) and [GRA-V Robotics](https://www.facebook.com/grav.robotics/). [Makers Making Change](https://makersmakingchange.com/) updated the design of the PCB and created a basic set of documentation for FreedomWing 1.1.

This device is Open Source Hardware. Everything needed to build the device is contained within this repository.
